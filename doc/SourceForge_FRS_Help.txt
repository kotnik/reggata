= Release Files for Download (FRS) =

[wiki:"What is SourceForge.net?" SourceForge.net] provides a File Manager as a means for projects to make files available for download by their users. In addition to the web based File Manager, !SourceForge provides an [wiki:"Shell service" interactive-shell service] for managing files. The File Manager and the interactive shell service provide different methods to manipulate the same files and folders. See [wiki:"Release files for download#AccessingReleasesviaShell" Accessing Releases via Shell] later in this document for more information.

Files released using the File Release System (FRS) are automatically distributed to our [wiki:"Mirrors" worldwide network of download mirrors], ensuring file availability, and providing great download performance to users.

All file releases should be a single file. Multiple files for the same release should be archived together (tar, deb, zip, etc.).  We recommend using rsync for all uploads over 20 megabytes in size, as rsync allows for resuming canceled or interrupted transfers.
----
You must be a project admin or have the "release technician" permission to manage files for a project.  There are several ways to manage your files:

Allowed characters for files and directories are: -_ +.,=#~@!()[]a-zA-Z0-9 (including " " - space). Disallowed characters are: &:%?/*$  Filenames may not start with a space or dot ("."), and may not end with a space (" ").

= File Manager (Web Interface) =

Select `Files` from the Project menu.  This is both the file manager (for admins) and the file browser (for visitors).

 * To create a folder, click `Add Folder`
 * To upload a file, click `Add File`
    * click Browse, and select your file(s)
    * click Upload
 
Clicking on the "i" icon enables your visitors to see more information about the file, such as SHA1 and MD5 hashes, how many times the file has been downloaded, and whether or not it is the default distribution for an OS. As a project admin, you can also click this icon to edit information about the individual file.
 * To rename a file or folder, click the "i" icon and edit the name.
    * '''''Note:''''' download statistics are based on file name, so stats for this file will be reset.  Your total project download count will include the previous name's stats.
 * To delete a file or folder, click the "-" icon
    * '''''Note:''''' Users are responsible for backing up all of their files. !SourceForge.net will not restore individual files.
 * To change file details, click the "i" icon
    * "Exclude stats" will omit this file from being counted in the download statistics
    * "Default download for" controls which file is the recommended download for visitors, based on their OS.  If not set for any file in the project, heuristics are used to automatically pick a recent upload with an appropriate file extension for the OS.
    * "Download button" allows you to change the label on the download button seen by your visitors.

= SCP =

User `jsmith` seeks to put `file.zip` to the `Rel_1` directory of his project, `fooproject`:

{{{
scp file.zip jsmith,fooproject@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/f/fo/fooproject/Rel_1
}}}

= Rsync =

User `jsmith` seeks to put `file.zip` to the `Rel_1` directory of his project, `fooproject`:

{{{
rsync -e ssh file.zip jsmith,fooproject@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/f/fo/fooproject/Rel_1/
}}}

= SFTP =

User `jsmith` seeks to put `file.zip` to the `Rel_1` directory of his project, `fooproject`:

{{{
$ sftp jsmith,fooproject@frs.sourceforge.net
Connecting to frs.sourceforge.net...
jsmith,fooproject@frs.sourceforge.net's password:

sftp>
}}}

= SSH =

Developers may use the [wiki:"Shell service"] to manage existing files and folders.

Log into the [wiki:"Shell service"] then your change directory based on your project UNIX name (Example project named "fooproject"):

{{{
cd /home/frs/project/f/fo/fooproject
}}}

= Release notes =

The file browser will show any README file it finds in the current folder (or parent folder) below the file listing.  This is useful to provide release notes, download instructions, etc. and it is highly recommended you make this available to your end users. [https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Files-Readme/ See here for more details]

Old per-file release note associations are still accessible by clicking on the "i" icon.

= Known limitations =

Moving files and creating of symlinks may be accomplished via the shell, but cannot be done with the web file manager.

There is special use for the keyword "latest" (it points to the default download for the project), so this will cause problems if used as a folder name in the File Release System.

= Migration from package/release system =

For projects that had releases available for download at the time of the change to the File Manager facility (July 2009), those files were migrated to logical folders. This is based upon the package & release names. 

In addition to the folders created for migrated package and releases, an "!OldFiles" folder was also created which contains files that were previously hidden. The "!OldFiles" folder is not visible to users downloading files from your project. If you wish to make a file visible, simply move it to a different folder.
