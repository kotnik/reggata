== About Reggata ==

Reggata - is a program for tagging user files on local computer. 
The project is not ready to use yet, because there are a lot of functions 
need to be implemented.

=== Alike projects ===
I would like Reggata to be like Delicious (http://www.delicious.com), but for tagging local files (and URL bookmarks also though) and storing all information in local database, not remote server.
Like Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/ which is for electronic books) or JBrout (http://jbrout.manatlan.com/ which is for digital photos) but for files of any type.
Like Tag2Find (http://www.tag2find.com/ which is for windows only as I know) but cross-platform.
Also, in the future I would like Reggata to have repository clone/merge features like Git (http://git-scm.com/), but without storing every last version state but only the last one.
